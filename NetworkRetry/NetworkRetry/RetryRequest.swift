/*
 Retry wrapper function around Alamofire.  This function passes through to Alamofire and
 in the event of a network down error, waits for the network to become available and
 retries the request.  It will perform the retry one time only.

 In addition to the standard Alamofire request parameters which are passed through, this function accepts:
     retry:Bool to indicate whether or not to retry on CFURLErrorNotConnectedToInternet
     waitInterval:Double indicates the time to wait on the network to reappear
     completion:AlamofireResponseCompletionHandler to be called when we finally accept a result from Alamofire.

 This function is implemented as a top level function in the manner of Alamofire's own calls
 The request object created by Alamofire is returned immediately and can be queried

    waitInterval:Double - how long to wait in seconds

    and returns true

    orUntil defaults to: { return false } which ensures that the method

    To work on background threads would require creating and adding timers
    to the thread in order to keep runUntilDate from immediately returning
